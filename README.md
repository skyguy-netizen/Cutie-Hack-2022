# Cutie-Hack-2022
- We built 2 softwares using OpenCV and Keras.
- The first one is a mask detection software, which tells you whether you are wearing a mask or not
- The second one is a celebrity lookalike software that tells you your celebrity lookalike
- We don't have a lot of data nor experience so our resutls aren't always accurate
